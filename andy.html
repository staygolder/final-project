							<p>Andrew Bauer was named director of music and coordinator of performing arts at Manhattan College in August. With more than 25 years of professional music experience, Bauer brings extensive knowledge as a music director and teacher to the College.</p>
							<p>Since 2004, he has served as music director and organist of the Monastery Church of the Sacred Heart in Yonkers, N.Y. For the past eight years, he has directed and conducted four choirs, and provided music for nearly 200 weddings and funerals each year. He currently instructs a variety of theater performances at the schools of the Sacred Heart, and is a part-time choir director for Mother Cabrini High School and St. Catharine Academy.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;I am excited to have Andy Bauer on board as we look to revamp our performing arts area this upcoming year,&rdquo; said John Bennett, director of Student Activities. &ldquo;I had the pleasure of working with Andy last academic year, as he filled in for all Commencement ceremonies, coordinating, conducting and performing all music at graduation. With his background of being the music director at the Monastery Church of the Sacred Heart, Andy&rsquo;s values closely reflect our own, which should make this a natural transition.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>In his new role, Bauer will direct the Music Ministry for regular and special liturgies and the Manhattan College Singers. He will also be the interim director of the Jazz Band, and will supervise all of the College&rsquo;s performing arts ensembles.</p>
							<p>After graduating from Bard College in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and music, Bauer completed a Bachelor of Music in 1988 and a Master of Music in 1990 from Manhattan School of Music. Since graduate school, he also worked for the Archdiocese of New York, as director of the Children&rsquo;s Choir for five years, music director of the Blackfriar&rsquo;s Repertory Theatre, and organist, choir director and music coordinator for St. John the Baptist Church and Nativity Church.</p>
							<p>Bauer is also a member of the American Society of Composers, Arrangers and Performers, and the New York Archdiocesan Music Commission. In addition, he has received commissions from<em>Magnificat Magazine</em>Â and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;It is a great honor and privilege to join the community of Manhattan College as director of music and coordinator of performing arts,&rdquo; Bauer said. &ldquo;I look forward to actively and enthusiastically developing the musical and aesthetic experience of the many talented students participating across our diverse spectrum of performing arts here at the school.&rdquo;</p>
