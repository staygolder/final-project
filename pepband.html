							<p>If you asked a student last year to name one student in the Pep Band, their response would be simple...</p>
							<p>We have a Pep Band?</p>
							<p>However, during the 2012-2013 school year, with our new performing arts director, and the best basketball season in recent memory, the pep band became legends!</p>
							<p>After performing up-beat songs through the entire season, and all the way up to Springfeild, Mass.	for	the	MAAC	tournament,	this	group received almost as much attention as the Basketball team themselves. </p>
							<p>Now the group performs not only at the Basketball games on and off campus, but you can find them in Gaelic Park, playing at the Lacrosse Games</p>
							<p>Unfortuneately, they aren't a marching band, but if you are looking to see your classmates in a parade, look no further than the<a href="pipesanddrums.html"> Manhattan College Pipes and Drums!</a></p>
