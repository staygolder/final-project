							<p>The Manhattan College Singers is a fifty person vocal ensemble at Manhattan College</p>
							<p>The group is not only made up of undergraduate and graduate students, but these students are joined by members of the community as well as some alumni! </p>
							<p>The group meets Wednesdays from 7-8:30 PM, so if you are free and love to sing, come join us.</p>
							<p>The group has two big performances, one each semester, as well as some smaller performances including the Fall Honors Convocation and Alumni Weekend.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Every winter the group, along with the <a href="orchestra.html">Manhattan College Orchestra</a>, performs in Lessons and Carols, which is a 2-hour Christmas Performance including reading by Campus Ministers and a tree lighting ceremony at the end.</p>
							<p>In the spring, the group performes in a Spring Concert with some of the other ensembles on campus. This performance has a program which is selected by the students. It is fun and upbeat so come listen!</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>This past fall, members of the Manhattan College singers went on to create and A Capella group, known as the <a href="manhattones.html">ManhatTONES</a>!</p>
